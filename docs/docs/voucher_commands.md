# Voucher Commands

TipBot could allow you to create voucher(s) and let other users (even not in Discord) to claim cryptocurrency from your tip balance. Currently, we support few coins including **WRKZ, WOW, GNTL**. We could expand the support to other coins/tokens in the future if there are more demands and requests.

Each time you create one or more vouchers, TipBot will deduct from your tip balance.
