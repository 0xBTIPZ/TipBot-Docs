# Guild Shop commands

It's possible you can sell your Discord Guild's role(s) for cryptocurrency that supported by our TipBot. Additionally, your Discord user could get more benefit when you (as a moderator of the Guild) set those selling roles with [Feature Role Command](./featurerole_commands.md) such as bonus for voting, time cooldown for Guild's faucet, bonus multiplier, etc.
