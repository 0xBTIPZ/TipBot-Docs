# Discord Commands

If you have any issue with these help, kindly join our Discord <http://join.btipz.com>.

## Command Notes

Our Discord TipBot is working only with / (slash command) as required by Discord.

### Deposit

You can check any supported coin in our Discord TipBot with `/deposit <token name>`. You can also select a `<token name>` from dropdown menu or you can type it directly.

Example `/balance token: wrkz`, `/balance token: doge`.

In case you would like to go to plain format of the address. `/deposit token: doge plain: plain`.

**Note**: Some coin/token requires <ins>MEMO</ins>. Please always include your unique <ins>MEMO</ins> if requires.

### Checking balance(s)

The balance can be checked everytime with `/balance <token name>`. If you would like to check all coins/tokens, please use `/balances` (with s). It's possible to check a coin/token's balance from `/deposit` menu. You would see a button "Balance".

**Note**: You can sort your balance by value $ or by alphabet. You can also add a coin/token to your favorite with the menu "Add" or "Remove". The favorite coins/tokens will be shown at the first page when you command `/balances`.
