* Where can I see the supported coin/tokens list?

You can check with `/coinlist` commands or go to <http://coininfo.bot.tips/>{:target="_blank"}

* My deposit hasn't arrive. How long does it take?

You can check each coin/token's information with `/coininfo coin:`, TipBot will show you the information such as network height, confirmation block, deposit & withdraw's status, etc. There could be a few reasons your deposit not arrive:

    * There is an issue with TipBot's daemon synchonization.
    If you can see the coin/token's network height is different from public explorer.

    * You deposit less than minimum. There are some tokens which requires minimum amount for deposit.
    If you deposit less than minimum amount, you can deposit accumulatively and TipBot will always check if the amount reach threshold.

    * There is an issue with public API. There are some tokens which we rely on public endpoint.
    There could be that the public API is down or offline.

    * Be patient and join our supported Guild for faster check.

* I would like to request adding a new coin/token.
