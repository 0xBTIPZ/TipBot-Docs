## Where can I see the supported coin/tokens list?

You can check with `/coinlist` commands or go to <http://coininfo.bot.tips/>{:target="_blank"}

## My deposit hasn't arrive. How long does it take?

You can check each coin/token's information with `/coininfo coin:`, TipBot will show you the information such as network height, confirmation block, deposit & withdraw's status, etc.

!!! note "There could be a few reasons your deposit not arrive yet:"

    * There is an issue with TipBot's daemon synchonization. 
    If you can see the coin/token's network height is different from public explorer.

    * You deposit less than minimum. There are some tokens which requires minimum amount for deposit. 
    If you deposit less than minimum amount, you can deposit accumulatively 
    and TipBot will always check if the amount reach threshold.

    * There is an issue with public API. There are some tokens which we rely on public endpoint. 
    There could be that the public API is down or offline.

    * Be patient and join our supported Guild for faster check.

!!! note

    * For a quick help, we advise you to join our Discord help channel either in [WrkzCoin](http://chat.wrkz.work){:target="_blank"} or in [BTIPZ](http://join.btipz.com){:target="_blank"}. Please try to explain your issue about deposit in more detail and better post your issue in public channel and avoid Direct Message with anyone even Dev (unless there's something you don't want other peopl eto see.)

    * Ask a smart question. Avoid general questions like "My deposit hasn't arrived.", 
    "Why I don't see my deposit?", "Do you mind if I ask you a question?" etc.
